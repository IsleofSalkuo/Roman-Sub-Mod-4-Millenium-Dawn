Bin Laden, Osama:

Look at Vietnam, look at Lebanon. Whenever soldiers start coming home in body bags, Americans panic and retreat. Such a country needs only to be confronted with two or three sharp blows, then it will flee in panic, as it always has.
[quoted in The Looming Tower, p. 187]
Any effort directed against America and the Jews yields positive and direct results, Allah willing. It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities.
May 1998
Your law is the law of the rich and wealthy people, who hold sway in their political parties, and fund their election campaigns with their gifts. Behind them stand the Jews, who control your policies, media and economy.
November 2002 (Letter to the American people)
We also advise you to pack your luggage and get out of our lands. We desire for your goodness, guidance, and righteousness, so do not force us to send you back as cargo in coffins.
November 2002 (Letter to the American people)

Bush, George W:

If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.
October 11, 2000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America.
September 11, 2001
Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended.
September 11, 2001
The resolve of our great nation is being tested. Make no mistake. We will show the world that we can pass this test.
September 11, 2001
Our military home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken the necessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government.
September 11, 2001
Make no mistake. The United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts.
September 11, 2001
This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.
September 16, 2001
Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
September 20, 2001
After all, this is a guy that tried to kill my dad at one time.
September 26, 2002 (about Saddam Hussein)

Bush, Jeb:

I told my brother we were going to deliver Florida; we're going to keep that promise, aren't we?
October 25, 2000
Please clap.
February 22, 2016 (upon finishing a campaign statement and not receiving applause)
You know what? As it relates to my brother, there is one thing I know for sure: he kept us safe.
July 16, 2016 (when asked about his brother George W Bush)

Cheney, Dick:

We also have to work, though, sort of the dark side, if you will.
September 16, 2001
You know, Paul, Reagan proved that deficits don't matter. We won the mid-term elections, this is our due.
January 9, 2004
What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action.
October 5, 2004
I don’t pay a lot of attention, frankly, to what Barack Obama says.
June 16, 2013

Chirac, Jacques:

You are my personal friend. Let me assure you of my esteem, consideration and bond.
September 5, 1974 (to Saddam Hussein)
France is the friend and ally of Iraq.
April 1986
Our house is burning and we look elsewhere. Nature mutilated, overexploited is not able to recover and we refuse to admit it.
September 2, 2002 (on climate change)
One does not export democracy in an armored vehicle.
March 11, 2007
Never make up with extremism, racism, antisemitism or rejecting whoever is different.
March 13, 2007
Irritable, rash, impetuous, disloyal, ungrateful, and un-French.
June 9, 2011 (about Nicolas Sarkozy)

Clinton, Bill:

I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
January 26, 1998
We want to live forever, and we're getting there.
October 12, 1999
Donald Trump has been uncommonly nice to Hillary and me. We're all New Yorkers. And I like him. And I love playing golf with him.
June 4, 2012

Clinton, Hillary:

One of my favorites is Angela Merkel because I think she's been an extraordinary, strong leader during difficult times in Europe, which has obvious implications for the rest of the world and, most particularly, our country... her bravery in the face of the refugee crisis is something that I am impressed by.
September 29, 2016

Colbert, Stephen:

Like all great theologies, Bill's can be boiled down to one sentence: There must be a god, because I don't know how things work.
January 6, 2011 (about Bill O'Reilly)

Cruz, Ted:

Reaganomics: You start a business in your parents' garage. Obamanomics: You move into your parents' garage.
July 20, 2013
We should not give $500 million to a corrupt organization that is selling unborn children's body parts.
September 28, 2015 (About Planned Parenthood)
The U.S. government is crushing liberty at nearly every turn. Our constitutional rights are under attack like never before and we must fight back.
September 29, 2015
Freedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.
July 20, 2016

Fischer, Joschka:

With all due respect, Mister President, you are an asshole.
October 26, 1984 (to Richard Stücklen)
The opposition seems to sometimes forget that we are doing politics and not presenting a theater play.
2001
Excuse me, I am not convinced.
2002 (to Donald Rumsfeld regarding the Iraq War)

Aurelius, Marcus :

How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything which happens in life.

Hollande, Francois:

The British have been particularly shy about the issues of financial regulation, and attentive only to the interests of the City – hence their reluctance to see the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and tax harmonisation in Europe.
May 8, 2012
We need intelligence services to fight against terrorism, but they have to respect the principles of good relationships between allies and protect personal, confidential data.
February 5, 2014

Hussein, Saddam:

The most important thing about marriage is that the man must not let the woman feel downtrodden simply because she is a woman and he is a man.
1978
I know that there are scores of people plotting to kill me, and this is not difficult to understand. After all, did we not seize power by plotting against our predecessors?
Summer 1979
Long live Iraq! Long live the Iraqi people! Down with the traitors!
November 5, 2006 (upon hearing of his death sentence)
There is no god but God and Muhammed is His prophet.

Jinping, Xi:

It was the greatest contribution towards the whole of the human race, made by China, is to prevent its 1.3 billion people from hunger.
February 11, 2009
Corruption could lead to the collapse of the Party and the downfall of the State.
February 25, 2013
Why must we stand firm on the party's leadership over the military? Because that's the lesson from the collapse of the Soviet Union. In Soviet Union, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. 
March 14, 2013 (regarding PLA ties to the CCP)
I think both sides should work hard to build a new type of relationship between big powers. The two sides should cooperate with each other for a win-win result in order to benefit people from the two countries and the world.
June 8, 2013 (on American-Chinese relations)
We should set our eyes on the future. The political differences between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan should eventually be solved step by step, and we can not let these problems hand on from generation to generation.
October 6, 2013

Jintao, Hu:

The Chinese are industrious, courageous, honest, and intelligent. They created the splendid ancient Chinese civilization. And today, they're firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and are making continuous progress in the modernization drive by carrying out the reform and opening up program.
April 20, 2006

Jones, Alex:

It's a gay bomb, baby. And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings. I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly. I mean, give me a break. Do you think I'm like, oh, shocked by it, so I'm up here bashing it because I don't like gay people? I don't like 'em putting chemicals in the water that TURN THE FREAKIN' FROGS GAY!
October 2015 (about tap water)
 
Merkel, Angela:

History has often showed us the strength of the forces that are unleashed by the yearning for freedom.
June 7, 2011
The yearning for freedom cannot be contained by walls for long.
June 7, 2011
The state has to assist and must not constrict. In this spirit it has to be the gardener and not the fence.
May 20, 2016
From my point of view, a completely covered woman has almost no chance of integrating herself in Germany.
August 19, 2016
For us Europeans, Africa as a neighboring continent is of prime importance. The development of African countries is in our very own vested interest. We, as Germans, but also we, as members of the European Union, will have to deal with this.
November 17, 2016
We work very closely together on the issue of annexation of Crimea and Russia’s attempt to actually conquer Ukraine. And actually they did so -- conquered part of the territory. We tried to come to a peaceful settlement here on this.
November 17, 2016
Our interests are very much aligned. Our attempts of cooperation are very much aligned.
November 17, 2016

Obama, Barack:

I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.
October 2, 2002
Let me be clear: I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power.
October 2, 2002
I'm proud of the fact that I stood up early and unequivocally in opposition to Bush's foreign policy. That opposition hasn't changed.
June 19, 2003
The Administration's failure to be consistently involved in helping Israel achieve peace with the Palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with Israel, as well as badly damaging to our standing in the Arab world.
July 24, 2004
That's silly talk... Talk to my wife. She'll tell me I need to learn to just put my socks on the hamper.
July 27, 2004 (about potential presidential aspirations)
There is not a liberal America and a conservative America — there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America — there's the United States of America.
July 27, 2004
In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?
July 27, 2004
I certainly didn't expect to find myself in this position a year ago. I've been struck by how hungry we all are for a different kind of politics.
January 16, 2007 (announcing his presidential campaign)
I know you didn't do this for me. You did this—you did this because you believed so deeply in the most American of ideas—that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it.
January 3, 2008 (Iowa Caucus Victory Speech)
John McCain once opposed these tax cuts — he rightly called them unfair and fiscally irresponsible. But now he has done an about face and wants to make them permanent, just like he wants a permanent occupation in Iraq. No matter what the costs, no matter what the consequences, John McCain seems determined to carry out a third Bush term.
March 20, 2008
Iran, Cuba, Venezuela — these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying, `We're going to wipe you off the planet."
May 18, 2008
Let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat.
May 19, 2008
I honor — we honor — the service of John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine. My differences with him are not personal; they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign.
June 3, 2008
If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.
June 14, 2008
By the way, I've been called worse on the basketball court. Its not a big deal.
September 4, 2008 (in response to remarks made by Sarah Palin)
Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.
January 21, 2009
Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now.
January 22, 2009
I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.
April 4, 2009
Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equal rights.
June 4, 2009
Let me just make this point, John. We're not campaigning anymore. The election's over.
February 25, 2010 (to his former election opponent John McCain)
Good evening. Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who’s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.
May 1, 2011
Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. 
November 6, 2012
The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with your vote. America's never been about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us together through the hard and frustrating, but necessary work of self-government.
November 6, 2012
Proudly, the United States has supported democracy and human rights in Cuba through these five decades.
December 17, 2014
Racism persists. Inequality persists.
May 7, 2016
He calls our military a disaster. Apparently, he doesn’t know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. He suggests America is weak. He must not hear the billions of men and women and children, from the Baltics to Burma, who still look to America to be the light of freedom and dignity and human rights.
July 28, 2016 (about Donald Trump)
He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, tells our NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection.
July 28, 2016 (about Donald Trump)
Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.
September 20, 2016
And as I said last night, my number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful.
November 10, 2016
And most of all, I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.
November 10, 2016 (to Donald Trump)

O'Reilly, Bill:

We'll do it live... WE'LL DO IT LIVE! FUCK IT! DO IT LIVE... look, I'll write it and we'll do it live! Fucking thing SUCKS!
Late 1980s (outtake remarks to a cameraman)
Saddam Hussein... I believe is involved with this World Trade Center and Pentagon bombing. I believe that you're going to find out that money from Iraq flowed in and helped this happen.
September 14, 2001 (about Saddam Hussein's alleged connections to al-Qaeda)

Putin, Vladimir:

I bow my head to the victims of terrorism. I am highly impressed of the courage of New York residents. The great city and the great American nation are to win!
November 15, 2001 (in an inscription at the WTC Memorial Wall)
Russia does not have in its possession any trustworthy data that supports the existence of nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and we have not received any such information from our partners as yet.
October 11, 2002 (about Saddam Hussein's Iraq)
For the preservation of the majestic Russia!
October 31, 2013
It's difficult to talk to people who whisper even at home, afraid of Americans eavesdropping on them. It’s not a figure of speech, not a joke, I'm serious.
April 17, 2014 (on American espionage efforts)
Sadly, it reminds me of World War II, when German fascist forces surrounded our cities, like Leningrad, and shelled population centres and their residents.
August 29, 2014 (on the Ukrainian siege of Donetsk and Luhansk)
We are guided by interests rather than feelings in dealing with our partners.
December 10, 2014
In America, torture was legalized, do you believe it?
December 18, 2014

Remnick, David:

What's frustrating to me sometimes about Obama is that the world seems to disappoint him. Republicans disappoint him, Bashar al-Assad disappoints him, Putin as well.
May 6, 2014 (about President Obama)

Rumsfeld, Donald:

I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to four hours?
2002 (in a secret memo regarding policy in Guantanamo prison)
Now, you're thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I don't. I think that's old Europe.
January 23, 2003 (regarding the Franco-German reaction to the Iraq War)
I don't believe anyone that I know in the administration ever said that Iraq had nuclear weapons.
May 14, 2003

Sarkozy, Nicolas:

If living in France bothers some people, they should feel free to leave the country.
April 22, 2007

I cannot bear Netanyahu, he's a liar.
November 8, 2011 (to Barack Obama)

Schröder, Gerhard:

We don't wage war, but we are called upon to impose a peaceful solution in Kosovo by military means as well.
March 24, 1999
As long as he lived, Yasser Arafat directed his efforts towards leading the Palestinians to independence and founding a sovereign viable Palestinian state.
November 11, 2004 (letter of condolence regarding Arafat's death)

Szekely, Louis:

Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler.
March 5, 2016

Trump, Donald:

I really don't believe I would, Rona. But I would like to see somebody as the president who could do the job, and there are very capable people in this country.
1980 (about presidential aspirations)
Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.
1987 [Art of the Deal, p. 63]
Get in, get it done, get it done right, and get out.
1987 [Art of the Deal, p. 65]
In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
1987 [Art of the Deal, p. 355]
Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. And I think, again, she’s given an agenda, it is not all of her, but I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her.
2007
Can you believe that,with all the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter
October 13, 2014
If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America?
April 16, 2015
When did we beat Japan at anything? 
June 16, 2015 (announcing his presidency)
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
June 16, 2015 (announcing his presidency)
I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we’ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
June 16, 2015 (announcing his presidency)
Obama is going to be out playing golf.
June 16, 2015 (announcing his presidency)
Why aren’t we letting ISIS go and fight Assad and then we pick up the remnants?
September 27, 2015
The truth is, he's a nasty guy.
January 17, 2016 (about Ted Cruz)
We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.
February 24, 2016
I think you've become very negative. Who knows. You'll have to ask your psychiatrist.
March 3, 2016 (to Bill O'Reilly)
I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him. I never met him. I don't think I've ever met him.
July 30, 2016
If our country got along with Russia, that would be a great thing.
July 30, 2016
He's a terrible president, he'll probably go down as the worst president in the history of our country, he's been a total disaster.
August 2, 2016 (about Barack Obama)
Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.
September 26, 2016
I’d never withdraw. I’ve never withdrawn in my life.
October 8, 2016
Because you’d be in jail.
October 9, 2016 (to Hillary Clinton)
I don’t care about my company. Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country.
